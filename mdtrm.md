#### Homework for Week 06 - October 8 + 10

* Prepare your midterm presentation! You will be creating a fully functioning website, styled with CSS. It is up to you if it is multiple pages or just one HTML page, but every design element must be well considered. On Tuesday and Thursday next week, you will have 5 minutes to present your midterm ideas and getting critique. Your presentation must include:

  * A concise elevator pitch: What are you making? Why? Your content should be well considered. You should be able to articulate the need for the website you will be creating. "It looks cool" is not enough of a reason.

	* A [mood board of images](https://www.smartbugmedia.com/blog/what-is-a-mood-board-and-how-can-it-influence-my-website-design), inspirations, color palette, etc. that demonstrate the look and feel

  * A detailed wireframe of your home page (I will be looking for consideration of grid systems, thoughtful color selection, typography, UX, etc)

  * A basic sitemap

  * REMEMBER: Your midterms will be presented for user testing in class on October 22 + 24th + final iterations uploaded to Github pages + linked to the wiki by Friday October 25 at 6pm.
