#### Course Pe-requisites:
Basic computer knowledge. Basic familiarity with any programming/scripting language is preferred but no required.

#### Course Description:
In this course, students focus on viewer (or client) side programming. Assignments are arranged in sequence to enable the production of a website of professional quality in design and production. This studio stresses interactivity, usability, and the quality and appropriateness of look and feel.

This course will provide a basic understanding of the methods and techniques of developing a simple to moderately complex web site. Using the current standard web page language, students will be instructed on creating and maintaining a simple web site using HTML5, CSS3, EcmaScript6 and various external libraries.

#### Program Learning Objectives
**Students will:**

1. develop conceptual thinking skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.

2. develop technical skills to realize their ideas.

3. develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic + technological contexts.

4. gain knowledge of professional practices and organizations by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking + career preparation.

5. develop collaboration skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

#### Student Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
1. Design, build, and develop content for a professional-quality website.

2. Understand and implement the iterative process

3. Learn how to proactively learn, also known as self-regulated learning. In any learning situation, you should study beforehand, make/do, debug, reflect, adjust, and do it all over again (iteration). Learning happens in a cycle.

4. Create an internal developer / creative community


#### Course Objectives

#### Course Structure

Class time will be spent as a combination of lecture, review, and in class exercises. Homework will consist of online tutorials as well as weekly projects that build on each week’s topics of discussion.

#### “Share” (or the class Wiki):
The class wiki - is where the rest of the syllabus including each day's resources, in-class and take-home assignments will be found. To turn in your homework you must either add text + images using the Markdown syntax or (more often) add a link to your work every week using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). You are required to post on the wiki. To contribute to the wiki you must set up a [Github](http://www.github.com) account.

#### Readings

Required readings + links to online tutorial will be provided through the class repo + wiki.

#### [Weekly Schedule](schedule.md)

#### Grading + Attendance Policy:
Class Participation (20% of grade): Please arrive on time having completed the assignments. Participation in class discussions and peer feedback are not only expected, but will be reflected in your grade.

Design + Technical Exercises (20% of grade): will be executed through the semester by following in class demonstrations, online tutorials and assigned readings. These exercises will be essential for learning markup and coding and to successfully complete more complex projects.

Documentation + Reflection (15% of grade):
Students will be expected to document their work + share it on the class wiki. In the first few weeks of class each student will set up a self-published site for supplementary narrative documentation. If you already have your own hosted website and would like to blog there, that works, too. (More info on server space forthcoming…)

Midterm Project (20% of grade)
The midterm assignment will be a project that demonstrates a working knowledge of HTML and CSS elements. This project must be completed, published + presented in class.

Final Project (25% of grade) 
Class will culminate with final projects. It is expected that these will be both technology and content driven. The final project will be built over the course of several weeks. This project must be completed, published + presented in class.

#### Qualitative Grading Overview
A. Excellent (90-100)
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. Work clearly differentiates itself from other work, has memorable impact, pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class. The student thoroughly understands the web design and development process.

B. Very Good / Good (80-89)
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been good, though not of the highest level. Work demonstrates a better than average web design and development process.

C. Satisfactory (70-79)
Performance and attendance of the student has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Work is average and competent, showing a basic understanding of the web design and development process.

D. Poor; Below Average (60-69)
Performance and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. Work is lacking in many or most areas that show any understanding of visual foundation. Problems may include lack of interest, procrastination, poor planning and poor craft.

F. Unacceptable (59 & Below)
Performance and attendance of the student has been such that course requirements have not been met. Work shows no overall understanding of the course material on many levels or either a severe lack of interest.
